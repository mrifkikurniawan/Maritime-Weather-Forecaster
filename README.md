# Maritime Weather Forecaster Using Hybrid AI of Neural Networks and Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System Optimized by Differential Evolution Algorithm


This repository consist of implementation of hybrid AI neural network and type-2 fuzzy logic system; then, both of them are optimized by differential evolution algorithm. Those methods are used for maritime weather forecasting.

To evaluating data with trained model, looks this [[folder](https://github.com/mrifkikurniawan/Maritime-Weather-Forecaster/tree/master/evaluate "folder")].
To training the new data, you can access [[here](https://github.com/mrifkikurniawan/Maritime-Weather-Forecaster/tree/master/training "here")]


Thanks to Taskin, A. and Kumbasar T. that has provided open source code and MATLAB toolbox of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system through this [[repository](https://github.com/ahmettaskin/type-2-fuzzy-logic-systems-matlab-toolbox "repository")].
